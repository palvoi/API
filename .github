# tyk-templates

Template repo for all your template needs.
- **For a new repo** 
  - Create your repository using this repo as a template ([GitHub instruction](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template)).
  - Rename the file `./.github/README-template.md` to `./.github/README.md` (remove the `-template` part) to get GitHub to display this README
  - Update `./.github/README.md` with the relevant content for your repo
- **For an existing repo** please make sure your repo has all the required templates which are defined in the [section below](#current-template-in-the-repo) by simply copying the relevant templates or add content that is in the template but not in your repo files.

## Asking users To sign CLA on submitting a pull request(for existing repo)

6. [License](./LICENSE)  *from tyk-gateway*
7. [Default Repo README](./.github/README-template.md), which resides in `/.github`
